This repository contains a high performance image processing framework based on Intel IPP.  There are a number of image codecs including BigTiff.  The use the solution in the wavescholar SolutionFiles repository to build the libraries. Project files are provided for Visual Studio 2010 with Intel Compiler for the unmanaged C++ and Fortran libraries. 

The best way to use build everything is to clone the following repositories to a folder that is mapped to d:  Libraries are included in the Visual Studio projects as files rather than lib includes,  therefore the paths need to match up.  Relative paths won't work for this setup.
